                Dearest readers, whilst we slept and soared on the wings of the lord of dreams, Duke Hasten of house Haven, caused quite the stir lastnight when he interrupted a game of poker with the sole intent of "teaching Marque Smellos a lesson". You may be wondering what caused this odd fight. Worry not your pretty heads because a little birdie who witnessed the incident told me that, Duke Hasten found out his betrothed lady Brie of house Frey took alittle walk into the stone garden with Marque Smellos. We all know what happens in that garden. <a href="post.html">READ MORE</a>

                    <p>
                        Dearest readers, a certain <em>belle</em> who just returned from Paris has become the talk of the town because she travelled and returned with a new flare for elaborate dinner parties.
